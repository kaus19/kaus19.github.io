<p>
Around Nov22 I got interested in running marathon when I went to visit a friend of mine who was participating in a half marathon event in Chiba, Japan. It was my first experience witnessing a marathon event and the joy in the face of runners was special. Those tired cheerful faces of both young and old people.<br>

Soon, I started my running journey soon after the event and I enrolled for my first marathon in early Mar23. I managed to convince some of my friends to participate as well.
